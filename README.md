I’ve been working as a Low-Code/No-Code Developer for the past 3 years, mainly on Unqork, where I’ve built applications that automate workflows, integrate with APIs, and make complex processes a lot simpler for end-users. During this time, I’ve learned how powerful low-code platforms can be in solving real business problems quickly.

Lately, I’ve been expanding my skills into Microsoft Power Platform and Salesforce, since I see these platforms driving a lot of digital transformation projects globally. I enjoy exploring how workflows, automation, and integrations can reduce manual effort and improve efficiency — and I’m always keen to learn new tools that fit into this space.

I’m particularly interested in opportunities where I can:

Build and scale apps using low-code/no-code platforms

Automate processes and integrate systems through APIs

Contribute to digital transformation initiatives in a collaborative, remote-friendly environment

Outside of coding and workflows, I like exploring how different tools connect together to create smarter solutions — that curiosity keeps me growing in this field.

I’m open to remote roles as a:

Low-Code/No-Code Developer

Power Platform Developer

Salesforce Administrator/Developer

Workflow Automation Specialist

If you’re looking for someone with a solid foundation in Unqork and a growing expertise in Power Platform and Salesforce, I’d be happy to connect.
